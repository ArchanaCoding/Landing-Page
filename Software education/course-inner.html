            <h3>Course Overview</h3>
            <p>It introduces the main idea of the course and describes the topics or concepts that the course covers.
                The overview can also describe the skills and knowledge your students need to be able to succeed in your
                course, as well as provide information about course requirements and staff.
                <br><br>
                A course description provides an overview of what a course covers, while a syllabus provides specific
                details about the course, such as the schedule, grading criteria, assignments, textbook requirements,
                and policies.The course description should be no longer than 100 words. Write from a student-centered
                perspective. Use present tense and active voice. Use clear and simple sentence structure and language.
                A course syllabus is written contract between you and your students that provides an outline or a
                summary of the main points of a text, lecture or course of study.
                <br><br>
                The purpose of a syllabus is to provide information on the course and define the scope of the
                content.Focus on the key words and the main ideas only. Key points in the text will usually be repeated,
                developed and highlighted; include these in your writing. Write your summary without referring to the
                original, making sure to include all the main points. Do not include examples or supporting evidence in
                your summary.
                It introduces the main idea of the course and describes the topics or concepts that the course covers.
                The overview can also describe the skills and knowledge your students need to be able to succeed in your
                course, as well as provide information about course requirements and staff.
                We use of course to refer to things that are obvious or already known to the speaker and listener, or to
                everybody: A tropical climate is, of course, very humid, so we sweated all the time. (We use commas
                here, before and after of course, to show that it refers to the whole of the first clause.)
                <br><br>
                Course structure refers to the choice of topics, organization, and sequencing of course content. The
                choice of topics and their organization should always support the learning objectives for the course.A
                course plan includes not only the goals and the content topics, but also how the topics will be taught
                and what the students will do during the course. In order to achieve end-of-semester goals, students
                must have practice during the semester, The act of summarizing is much like stating the plot of a play.
                For instance, if you were asked to summarize the story of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet,' you might say: It's
                the story of a young prince of Denmark who discovers that his uncle and his mother have killed his
                father, the former king.The summary appears on the course listings page. This field is searched when
                searching for a course and also appears in the Course/Site description block. The capability moodle/All
