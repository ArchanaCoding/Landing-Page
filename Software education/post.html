                <h3>Learn Web Development In The Easiest Way</h3>
                <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating,
                    building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may,
                    however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.
                    Websites can be broadly classified into three main types: static websites, dynamic websites, and
                    e-commerce websites. Each type has its own characteristics, advantages, and use cases. Let's take a
                    closer look at each.
                    <br><br> 
                    A web developer makes and maintains websites. They are in charge of a site's overall look
                    and feel. Web developers also handle the technical aspects of a website, including its performance
                    (website speed) and capacity (the maximum amount of traffic the site could handle at a given time).
                    Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products you are offering,
                    understand why your products are relevant and even necessary for them to buy or use, and see which
                    of your company's qualities set it apart from competitors.
                    What is HTML? HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for
                    creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page.

                    Web developer skills are often applied to the non-design aspects of building websites
                    writing markup and coding. Web developers may also use content management systems (CMS) to make
                    content changes easier for other developers or end-users who may lack technical skills.

                    HTML vs Python: A Comprehensive Comparison. HTML has a relatively easy learning curve as it
                    primarily focuses on defining the structure and content of web pages. It involves understanding the
                    basic tags and their usage. Python is a beginner friendly and a very simple programming language.
